## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome to my personal Data Science portfolio repository! This collection represents the work I have built up over time as part of my ongoing journey to strengthen and refine my skills in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and Data Science as a whole.

Each project in this repository tackles a unique real-world dataset and approaches it from different analytical angles:

- 🧹 Some projects place a heavy emphasis on **data cleaning** — handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and preparing raw data for analysis.
- 📈 Others are more focused on **data visualization** — uncovering patterns, trends, and insights through compelling and informative charts.
- 🔬 And then there are projects that bring **both disciplines together** for a full end-to-end exploratory experience.

Whether you are a beginner just getting started with Data Science or someone looking to see how different datasets can be approached analytically, this repository is designed to be a **practical, open learning resource**. Feel free to browse through the code, study the techniques used, and take whatever you find useful for your own learning journey.
